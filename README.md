# Game Central

Welcome to the One Piece Fan Page project! This is a dedicated space to explore and celebrate the captivating world created by Eiichiro Oda in One Piece. Here, you'll find information about the characters, the world, the story, and various media related to this incredible manga and anime.

## Description

**Game Central** is an engaging web-based gaming platform tailored specifically for younger audiences. It features a collection of familiar games such as Rock-Paper-Scissors, presented in a vibrant, cartoon-style aesthetic that appeals to children. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this platform is designed to provide a fun and safe environment for kids to enjoy interactive games.

## Site Owner Goals
The primary goal of Game Central is to captivate a young audience with user-friendly and entertaining games that can be played on any web browser. This project aims to foster a love for simple, classic games while providing a digital platform where children can spend time safely. Additionally, as a budding web developer, this project serves to sharpen my skills in web development and enrich my professional portfolio with a project that has real-world utility and appeal.

## Development Life Cycle
### Project Planning

The planning phase of Game Central was methodical. Here’s how it was structured:

1. **Goal Identification**: The first step involved clearly defining the objectives of the project. The main goal was identified as creating a fun and engaging platform for younger audiences with a selection of simple games. Secondary goals included using this project to enhance my web development skills and expand my portfolio.

2. **Target Audience Research**: Understanding the needs and preferences of the target audience—children—was crucial. This involved researching cognitive and physical capabilities of different age groups to ensure the games and UI/UX design were age-appropriate and engaging.

3. **Wireframing and Prototyping**: Sketches and wireframes were created using Balsamiq. This helped visualize the layout and transitions between different screens and interactions within the games.

4. **Technology Stack Decision**: Decisions on the tech stack were made early in the planning phase. HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript were chosen for their versatility and support for complex interactive designs.

5. **Risk Assessment and Contingency Planning**: Potential risks like timeline delays, and technical challenges were identified. 


### Research and Design
During the research phase, existing gaming websites/mobile-games were analyzed to determine popular functionalities and design trends. The design was crafted to be colorful and engaging, utilizing cartoon graphics and animations to capture the interest of young users.

### Content Requirements
The content for Game Central consists mainly of visual elements to support the games, including background images, game icons, and interactive buttons designed to be large and easy to interact with. Descriptive text is minimal, straightforward, and uses simple language suitable for children. Each game includes brief, easy-to-understand instructions.

### Development
- Environment Setup: Configured the development environment, including Git for version control and Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
- Implementation:
  * Phase 1: Developed the site structure using HTML5, ensuring semantic markup for accessibility.
  * Phase 2: Applied CSS for styling, with Bootstrap to aid responsive design. The platform was made responsive using CSS Flexbox and Grid, ensuring that it is accessible on a variety of devices, including tablets and smartphones typically used by children.
  * Phase 3: Developed javascript code for interactive elements.
  * Phase 3: Focused on content creation, populating the site with character descriptions, images, and media-related information.
